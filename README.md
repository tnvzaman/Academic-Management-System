# Academic-Management-System
Inspired by Usis system of BRAC University. Here, i tried to create a management system where there are two users: student and faculty. Each of these users will have to go through an login page and have different and unique pages to view. Student will be able to see their courses, class schedule and grades whereas faculty in their pages will be able to assign those courses to the selected student and publish the schedules as well as grades.

This project was developed by PHP, CSS, HTML and Javascript
